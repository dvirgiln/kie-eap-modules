BxMS & Fuse Integration Pack 
============================

Fuse Integration Packs
----------------------
Fuse provides a feature to generate an assembled package (named Integration Pack) which goal is to generate and apply different EAP module and subsystem configurations in an automated way and considering other possible existing integration packs to manage.                     

BxMS & Fuse Integration Pack goal
---------------------------------
The goal for this module is build the **Fuse EAP Integration pack for BxMS**. It provides features for deploying BxMS modules into an EAP installation, providing an easier integration with Fuse and other modules and an easier deployment on JBoss EAP instances.                                          

Currently it does:            
* Add into the layers.conf either `bpms` or `brms` as layer name value. The default value is `bpms`.
